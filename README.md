# 40-yard-dash

This is my independent project for a capstone biology class. 
"How Organisms Move" culminated in a final project that you see here; I explored how BMI's and relative body proportions alter an athlete's speed and explosiveness.
The NFL's 40 yard dash was my metric for speed and the first 10 yard split as my metric for explosiveness.

Project Presentation.pptx contains the formal presentation of my data analysis.
